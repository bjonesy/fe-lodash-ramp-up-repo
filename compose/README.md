# lodash/fp/compose

Compose applies the parameters to the right most function, passing the result to the function to it's left.

## Test One

First, complete the `reduce` example.

Next, create an `id` function using map - which is just a function standing in for a value as outlined in Chapter 5 of FP [here](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide-old/content/ch5.html#category-theory) 

Then, use the function `reduce` and the `id`  function to the sum of all the numbers in the array.

## Documentation

lodash documentation for [flowright](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#flowRight) is similar to `lodash/fp/compose`
