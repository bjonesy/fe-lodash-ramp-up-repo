# lodash/fp/isEmpty

Checks if value is an empty object, collection, map, or set.

Objects are considered empty if they have no own enumerable string keyed properties.

Array-like values such as arguments objects, arrays, buffers, strings, or jQuery-like collections are considered empty if they have a length of 0. Similarly, maps and sets are considered empty if they have a size of 0.

## Test One

Check each value to see how `isEmpty` will work to determine if `isEmpty` will return true or false.
